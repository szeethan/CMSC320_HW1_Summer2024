\f0\fs24 \cf0 I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I am an aspiring trader who is seeking to gain exposure in the quantitative finance field. I have already taken the foundational courses and I look to continue developing my skills through coursework, internships, and personal projects. I see CMSC320 as a stepping stone to achieving my goal of combining my love for finance and data science to drive real world impact. Additionally, this course is required for my CS concentration :).}
